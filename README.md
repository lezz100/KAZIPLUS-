# KAZIPLUS-

This project is meant for university students and lecturers where they can easily create timetables and set up venues easily. This information directly reflects on the students side without necessarily relying on third parties like the class representatives. On the other hand,This project keeps sending notifications and reminders to students just an hour or two before the class itself starts. This can easily remind students on the classes they might havve forgotten about.
